    /**
     * A table used by `require` to control how to load modules.
     *
     * Each entry in this table is a searcher function. When looking for a module, `require` calls each of these
     *   searchers in ascending order, with the module name (the argument given to `require`) as its sole parameter. The
     *   function can return another function (the module loader) or a string explaining why it did not find that module
     *   (or nil if it has nothing to say). Lua initializes this table with four functions.
     *
     * The first searcher simply looks for a loader in the `package.preload` table.
     *
     * The second searcher looks for a loader as a Lua library, using the path stored at `package.path`. A path is a
     *   sequence of templates separated by semicolons. For each template, the searcher will change each interrogation
     *   mark in the template by `filename`, which is the module name with each dot replaced by a "directory separator"
     *   (such as "`/`" in Unix); then it will try to open the resulting file name. So, for instance, if the Lua path is
     *   the string
     *
     *      "./?.lua;./?.lc;/usr/local/?/init.lua"
     *
     * the search for a Lua file for module `foo` will try to open the files `./foo.lua`, `./foo.lc`, and
     *   `/usr/local/foo/init.lua`, in that order.
     *
     * The third searcher looks for a loader as a C library, using the path given by the variable `package.cpath`. For
     *   instance, if the C path is the string
     *
     *      "./?.so;./?.dll;/usr/local/?/init.so"
     *
     * the searcher for module `foo` will try to open the files `./foo.so`, `./foo.dll`, and `/usr/local/foo/init.so`,
     *   in that order. Once it finds a C library, this searcher first uses a dynamic link facility to link the
     *   application with the library. Then it tries to find a C function inside the library to be used as the loader.
     *   The name of this C function is the string "`luaopen_`" concatenated with a copy of the module name where each
     *   dot is replaced by an underscore. Moreover, if the module name has a hyphen, its prefix up to (and including)
     *   the first hyphen is removed. For instance, if the module name is `a.v1-b.c`, the function name will be
     *   `luaopen_b_c`.
     *
     * The fourth searcher tries an all-in-one loader. It searches the C path for a library for the root name of the
     *   given module. For instance, when requiring `a.b.c`, it will search for a C library for `a`. If found, it looks
     *   into it for an open function for the submodule; in our example, that would be `luaopen_a_b_c`. With this
     *   facility, a package can pack several C submodules into one single library, with each submodule keeping its
     *   original open function.
